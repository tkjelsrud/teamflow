        Isometric? more trouble than its worth or cool?

        Fewer items on the boards, readability - zoom out a little, lets say they are epics

        Design principles
        Sharing a URL means sharing that exact "run", including seeds for random and config
        Configs are small and modular
        ?seed=000000&setup=AAA:3:3,BBB:4:2,TEAMC:3:3&scen=scenario-A
